This is a sample post for checking how the layout looks like. There's nothing important wrtitten in this article.

<Box>

The hot reload function is great.

As soon as I save the file, it is reflected on the page.

</Box>

Box component looking great.

I still have lots of components to work on, such as lists, code blocks, blockquotes, etc.

Another important one is Image. I still don't know how to use it efficiently in mdx.

I need to do it so that the pages will be blazing fast.

## This is the sample of h2 title tag

Here's the sample text for chekcing the layout. Nothing important here. This is just a placeholder when the text is long. I want to make this longer than it already is, so I am going to write a couple more times so that the text will be eventually long in the end.

Now it's time to see other h tags in action.

### the h3 tags right here

This tag looks good. The size is perfect and still not too small to recognize as a title, but not too big so that this looks like a heading 1 tag.

One more thing I need to work on is margins. For now, every element has `margin-top` of `1em`, but the problem is that it is nested. Even if I wanna change it one by one, it's not possible because the nested styles are stronger than unnested ones. In the end, those styles overwrite the defualt styles. I need to come up with a way to solve this problem soon.

This is a sample post for checking the layout. In this article, I'm gonna write a long text so that I can check the design.

<Box boxType="success">
  This is the box style. The Box component takes a prop called 'boxType'. In
  this particular box, I passed a string 'success' and now the box has a success
  color that I set which is light blue.
</Box>

Now, let's talk about my new year's resolution.

I don't think I could easily come up with ones that I want to keep going for. For now, I have many ideas but everything is uncertain if I could achieve it or not.

I know I should make up my mind and do it, so I will decide which one to achieve in this post.

I do have one resolution that I should go for no matter what. It is the same as last year's resolution which was to earn 5,000,000 yen per year.

Apparently I failed to achieve it last year. It wasn't even close. I earned only around the half of it which is way too low for my age.

So, this year, it's like a MUST to achieve it, or I should quit this job and look for another option.

<Box boxType="warning">
  The main reason why I failed was because I forgot about the resolution and
  didn't try hard to achieve it.
</Box>

This year, I won't let it happen. Actually I need money this year, so I will achieve it for sure. I have to.

## The reason why I need money

I am going to Thailand and stay there for 1 year using ED visa.
In order to do that, I need to have enough money for living, party, and school.

I cannot cut myself out from all the parties and playing, but I do need to figure out how to balance.

Last year, I played way too much more than I worked. That was really fun but also it was bad at the same time.
