If you have a personal blog or a website, you might wanna have a comment section that you can interact with the visitors.

As I started my blog in Next.js, I wanted to have a comment system, but I also didn't wanna create everything from scratch, because it would be a lot of work to do so. I looked for the options to implement a comment system, and I found a perfect tool called **giscus**.

In this article, I will explain how to set up a comment system using giscus in Next.js project.

## What is Giscus?

Giscus is a GitHub Discussions-powered comment system. Here's a quick overview of giscus:

<Box type="success_l">
  <UnorderedList>
    <li>100% free, no ads and no tracking</li>
    <li>Open source</li>
    <li>No database needed</li>
    <li>Support custom themes and multiple languages</li>
  </UnorderedList>
</Box>

If you wanna see what it's like in action, you can simply [click here](#enjoy-interacting-with-the-visitors-by-using-giscus) or scroll all the way to the bottom of this page to test it out yourself.

### Important note

Before I explain how to set up giscus, I wanna share a few things that you need to consider whether giscus is right for your project or not.

Firstly, **your repository must be public** because giscus uses GitHub Discussions. If the repository is private, the visitors won't be able to view the discussion.

Secondly, **the visitors must have a GitHub account** to leave a reaction or a comment. This should not be a problem if you are running a tech blog where you can expect your visitors to have a GitHub account, but if not, you should reconsider using giscus.

## How to set up giscus in your Next.js project

I'll explain how to set up Giscus in your Next.js project. If you wanna follow the official documentation, you can check out from [here](https://giscus.app/).

### 1. Enable GitHub discussions

First, navigate to your project repository on GitHub, and make sure your repository is public.

Then, click **Settings** and scroll down to Discussions.

<BlogImage

  alt="Click Settings"
  width={1400}
  height={192}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

In the Discussions section, check the box to enable Discussions.

<BlogImage

  alt="Set up discussions"
  width={1086}
  height={476}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

Now, you have successfully enabled Discussions in your repository.

### 2. Install giscus app in your repository

You need to install giscus app in your repository.

To do so, you open the [giscus app page](https://github.com/apps/giscus) and hit the install button.

<BlogImage

  alt="Install giscus app"
  width={1888}
  height={960}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

You can choose to install giscus app in either all repositories or only selected repositories that you wanna use it.

<BlogImage

  alt="Install giscus app"
  width={1200}
  height={1479}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

After selecting the repository, click install and wait until it's done.

### 3. Connect your repository to giscus

Now that you've installed giscus in your repository, it's time to connect to giscus.

First, navigate to [https://giscus.app/](https://giscus.app/) and go to Configuration.

In the Repository section, type in your GitHub username and repository name.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/giscus-comment-system/giscus-config-repo.png"
  alt="Connect your repository"
  width={1200}
  height={460}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

If everything is working, success message will show up.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/giscus-comment-system/giscus-config-repo-success.png"
  alt="Connect your repository - Success"
  width={1200}
  height={460}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

After that, you can configure the following on your own.

<Box type="success_l">
  <UnorderedList>
    <li>Page Discussions Mapping</li>
    <li>Discussion Category</li>
    <li>Features</li>
    <li>Theme</li>
  </UnorderedList>
</Box>

Once you configured everything, the `script` tag becomes available. We will use the tag in the next step.

  alt="Enable giscus using the script tag"
  width={1502}
  height={880}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

### 4. Install giscus package

Giscus offers a package for creating a wrapper component.

You could actually use the `script` that's generated, but I personally prefer using `@giscus/react` package.

<CodeHead lang="console" />

```console
npm i @giscus/react
```

### 5. Create a giscus component

Now, we create a component for giscus. The component should look like this:

<CodeHead name="/components/comments.jsx" lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers
import Giscus from "@giscus/react";

export default function Comments() {
  return (
    <Giscus
      id="comments"
      repo="giscus/giscus-component"
      repoId="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTEzMTMwMjA="
      category="Announcements"
      categoryId="DIC_kwDOF1L2fM4B-hVS"
      mapping="specific"
      term="Welcome to @giscus/react component!"
      reactionsEnabled="1"
      emitMetadata="0"
      inputPosition="top"
      theme="light"
      lang="en"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  );
}
```

For the props, first you got to the [giscus website](https://giscus.app/) and copy the `script` tag. Then remove `data-` from the prop names, and write them in `camelCase`.

For more information, you can read the [giscus-component](https://github.com/giscus/giscus-component) page on GitHub.

### 6. Import a giscus component in a page

Now that we've finished all the setup, we only need to import and use the giscus component wherever you want.

For me, I used it in `/pages/posts/[slug].js` because that's where my blog contents live.

<CodeHead name="/pages/posts/[slug].js" lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers {7}
import Comments from "@/components/comments.jsx";

const PostLayout = ({ post }) => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {/* All the contents here... */}
      <Comments />
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default PostLayout;

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // ...
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // ...
}
```

I have omitted the unnecessary code, but this is the overview of what my page component looks like.

Now, if you navigate to the page that you set the component, you will see the comment widget successfully shown in the designated place ðŸŽ‰

## Enjoy interacting with the visitors by using giscus

That is all! Now you have a comment system in your Next.js project, without setting up a server.

I hope you find this article helpful, and please leave a reaction or comment if you wanna test it out in here.
