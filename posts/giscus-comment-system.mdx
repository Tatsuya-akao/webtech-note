## What is Giscus?

Giscus is a GitHub Discussions-powered comment system. It is 100% free and open source, and no ads and no tracking.

Here's a quick overview of Giscus:

- 100% free, no ads and no tracking
- Open source
- No database needed
- Support custom themes and multiple languages

Without having a server, you can manage your comments on GitHub Discussions.

To use Giscus, your repository must be public.

## Install Giscus

I'll explain how to set up Giscus in your Next.js project. If you wanna follow the official documentation, you can check out from [here](https://giscus.app/).

### 1. Enable GitHub discussions

First, navigate to your project repository on GitHub, and make sure your repository is public.

Then, click `Settings` and scroll down to Discussions.

  alt="Click Settings"
  width={1400}
  height={192}

  hasShadow
/>

In the Discussions section, check the box to enable Discussions.

  alt="Set up discussions"
  width={1086}
  height={476}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

Now, you have successfully enabled Discussions in your repository.

### 2. Install giscus app in your repository

You need to install giscus app in your repository from [https://github.com/apps/giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus).

Once you open the giscus app page, hit the install button.

<BlogImage

  alt="Install giscus app"
  width={1888}
  height={960}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

You can choose to install giscus app in either all repositories or only selected repositories that you wanna use it.

  alt="Install giscus app"
  width={1200}
  height={1479}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

After selecting the repository, click install and wait until it's done.

### 3. Connect your repository to giscus

Now that you've installed giscus in your repository, it's time to connect to giscus.

First, navigate to [https://giscus.app/](https://giscus.app/) and go to Configuration.

In the Repository section, type in your GitHub username and repository name.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/giscus-comment-system/giscus-config-repo.png"
  alt="Connect your repository"
  width={1200}
  height={460}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

If everything is working, success message will show up.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/giscus-comment-system/giscus-config-repo-success.png"
  alt="Connect your repository - Success"
  width={1200}
  height={460}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

After that, you can configure the following on your own.

<Box type="success_l">
  <UnorderedList>
    <li>Page Discussions Mapping</li>
    <li>Discussion Category</li>
    <li>Features</li>
    <li>Theme</li>
  </UnorderedList>
</Box>

Once you configured everything, the `script` tag becomes available. We will use the tag in the next step.

  alt="Enable giscus using the script tag"
  width={1502}
  height={880}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

### 4. Install giscus package

Giscus offers a package for creating a wrapper component.

You could actually use the `script` that's generated, but I personally prefer using `@giscus/react` package.

<CodeHead lang="console" />

```console
npm i @giscus/react
```

### 5. Create a giscus component

Now, we create a component for giscus. The component should look like this:

<CodeHead name="/components/comments.jsx" lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers
import Giscus from "@giscus/react";

export default function Comments() {
  return (
    <Giscus
      id="comments"
      repo="giscus/giscus-component"
      repoId="MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTEzMTMwMjA="
      category="Announcements"
      categoryId="DIC_kwDOF1L2fM4B-hVS"
      mapping="specific"
      term="Welcome to @giscus/react component!"
      reactionsEnabled="1"
      emitMetadata="0"
      inputPosition="top"
      theme="light"
      lang="en"
      loading="lazy"
    />
  );
}
```

For the props, first you got to the [giscus website](https://giscus.app/) and copy the `script` tag. Then remove `data-` from the prop names, and write them in `camelCase`.

For more information, you can read the [giscus-component](https://github.com/giscus/giscus-component) page on GitHub.

### 6. Import a giscus component in a page

Now that we've finished all the setup, we only need to import and use the giscus component wherever you want.

For me, I used it in `/pages/posts/[slug].js` because that's where my blog contents live.

<CodeHead name="/pages/posts/[slug].js" lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers {7}
import Comments from "@/components/comments.jsx";

const PostLayout = ({ post }) => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {/* All the contents here... */}
      <Comments />
    </Layout>
  );
};

export default PostLayout;

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // ...
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // ...
}
```

I have omitted the unnecessary code, but this is the overview of what my page component looks like.

Now, if you navigate to the page that you set the component, you will see the comment widget successfully shown in the designated place ðŸŽ‰

## Enjoy interacting with the visitors by using giscus

That is all! Now you have a comment system in your Next.js project, without setting up a server.
