I ran into some errors when I deployed my Next.js project to Vercel.

- Error(num)
- Error(num)
- Error(num)

These errors didn't show up in the development emvironment, and only in production. Also, pages work without any problem with these errors.

## How I solved these errors

I noticed that the errors only occur in pages where I use `new Date`, and the problem was because the timezone in Vercel and my location differs, which causes these rendering errors.

To fix these errors, you need to install some packages.

```
npm install date-fns date-fns-tz
```

These packages are used for formatting published date.

If your timezone is other than 'US', this article will help you solve these errors.

### 1. Install packages

### 2. Replace new Date with utcToZonedTime
