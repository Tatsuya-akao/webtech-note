When you create components such as `Button` or `Heading` which output elements with various options of HTML tags, what do you do?

<Box>
  This should have a gray color because the props for the coloring is not
  passed, hence it has the default light gray color.
</Box>

In this article, I am going to explain how to pass HTML tags with props in React.

## How to implement snow falling effect using JavaScript and CSS

<Box type="success">This is the sample box.</Box>

By doing this, you can pass any kinds of heading tags.

I hope you learn something new from this article.

Here's another box that has a props of `warning`.

## HTML

<Box type="warning">
  This is the warning box. See how the background color is different than the
  previous one which has no props passed.
</Box>

### What you need to think about

<CodeHead lang="js" />

```js showLineNumbers {4}
const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");
const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");

const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");
const btn = document.querySelector(".btn");
```

For using Sass, I actually use SCSS syntax for it. The title says it's Sass and it's not wrong, but SCSS to be more specific. For using Sass, I actually use SCSS syntax for it. The title says it's Sass and it's not wrong, but SCSS to be more specific.

<CodeHead name="index.html" lang="html" />

```html showLineNumbers
<div class="sample classes-here">
  <p>This is the html template for checking the layout...</p>
  <p>Just random text in here.</p>
</div>
```

## JavaScript

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/first-post.png"
  alt="sample img"
  width={1600}
  height={900}
  caption="This is a sample caption for blog image component. When a string is passed to the caption prop, this gets rendered. Otherwise, this figcaption won't appear."
/>

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/first-post.png"
  alt="sample img"
  width={1600}
  height={900}
/>

This is the sample text that comes in under the image. The sentence must have at least several lines so that I can check it better. This is the sample text that comes in under the image. The sentence must have at least several lines so that I can check it better.

<Box type="success">
<CodeHead name="app/index.jsx" lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers
import margin from "@/styles/components/blog/margin.module.scss";
import { IoLogoJavascript, IoLogoHtml5 } from "react-icons/io5";

export default function CodeHead({ name, lang }) {
  const langData = outputLanguageString(lang);

  return (
    <div className={`${s.code_head} ${margin.t_medium}`}>
      <div className={s.text_wrap}>
        {name && <span className={s.name}>{name}</span>}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## JavaScript

This is the p tag I guess.

</Box>

### Create a function for snow falling

The CSS code looks like below.

<CodeHead name="app/index.css" lang="css" />

```css showLineNumbers
.box {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
}

.box::before {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  padding-top: 100%;
}
```

<CodeHead lang="css" />

```css showLineNumbers
.box {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
}

.box::before {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  padding-top: 100%;
}
```

For using Sass, I actually use SCSS syntax for it. The title says it's Sass and it's not wrong, but SCSS to be more specific.

<CodeHead lang="scss" />

```scss showLineNumbers
.box {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
}

.box::before {
  content: "";
  display: block;
  padding-top: 100%;
}
```

> This is the quoted text. This can be multi line text.
> It can be like this.
> It can be like this.
> The end of blockquote.

Now the hot reload seems not working.

<Box type="success">
  <UnorderedList>
    <li>
      <OuterLink href="google.com">test link</OuterLink>
    </li>
    <li>
      <OuterLink>test link</OuterLink>
