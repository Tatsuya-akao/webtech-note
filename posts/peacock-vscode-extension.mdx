When I am working on a project, I open multiple VS Code window. When you have many instances open in your window, it is hard to distinguish each instance.

## Enter your own color

If you are not satisfied with the default color settings, you can give one yourself by selecting "Enter a color".

You basically have to copy the color code you want, and paste it in the input.

Hot reload stopped?

I don't know why??

It is definitely not working....

HOW!!!
