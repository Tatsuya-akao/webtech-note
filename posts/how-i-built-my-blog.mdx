I originally own a blog on WordPress, where I share my knowledge and experience as a web developer. Now that I've spent almost 3 years working on it, I decided to start a new blog with modern tech stack.

After struggling for a few months, I managed to deploy this blog which is my very first Next.js project. In this article, I'm gonna briefly explain how I built this MDX blog with Next.js.

<Box type="warning">
  This article is <span>not a step-by-step guide or tutorial.</span> I'll post
  an another article for that topic.
</Box>

## Tech Stack

Here's the list of the tech stack I used for this blog, and I'll explain why I chose them.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [CSS Modules (Sass)](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home)

### Next.js

Next.js is a React framework for building web applications. I chose Next.js for the following reasons.

<Box type="success">
  <UnorderedList>
    <li>It is built with React</li>
    <li>It offers two types of pre-rendering: SSR and SSG</li>
    <li>It has many performance optimizations</li>
    <li>It works great with MDX</li>
  </UnorderedList>
</Box>

For pre-rendering options, I use SSG (Static Site Generation) because my blog contents are totally static. It generates the HTML at build time, and it will be reused on each request, unlike SSR that generates the HTML on every request.

On top of SSG, Next.js has so many performance optimization such as code-splitting, `next/image`, `next/font`, `next/script`, etc.

These features make the website super fast.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/first-post.png"
  alt="sample img"
  width={1600}
  height={900}
  caption="This is a sample caption for blog image component. When a string is passed to the caption prop, this gets rendered. Otherwise, this figcaption won't appear."
/>

### CSS Modules (Sass)

For styling, I used CSS Modules with Sass. I chose them simply because I have been using Sass for years and feel comfortable with it.

CSS Modules are supported by default, and all you need is to add `module.css` at the end of a file (in my case, `module.scss`) and then you can write component-scoped styles with all those powerful features in Sass.

I'll probably try some of CSS in JS libraries later on, but for now I'm satisfied with CSS Modules with Sass.

### MDX

MDX is like a conbination of markdown and JSX. This means you can import React components into your markdown files.

I write articles in `mdx` files.

The coolest thing about MDX is that, on top of markdown syntax, **you can use JSX and React components.**

This means you can build your own custom components and import it wherever you want in your blog articles.

### Contentlayer

I manage my mdx files using Contentlayer. Contentlayer is a content preprocessor.

By using this, you can safely manage your contents with type-safe JSON.

I have tried to build a MDX blog by following a tutorial in Next.js docs, but it was so complicated and I had to write so many code just to get articles data.

In Contentlayer, you can get the data by writing a single code, and you can do whatever you want with it.

I'm not gonna go over how to get articles without Contentlayer, but this is so much easier than the one in Next.js tutorial.

### Vercel

I host this blog on Vercel. I simply chose it because Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and I thought it would work the best.

### Giscus

I use Giscus for implementing comment functionality. The reasons I chose Giscus was because:

- Easy to use
- Free and no ads
- Only Github users can leave comments

It's completely free and you don't need to put ads that look ugly.

Another good thing is that only Github users can comment, so it has a certain level of security and low risk of spamming.

There's a similar package called [Utterances](https://google.com) which also uses Github. One of the differences is that Utterances use Github issues, while Giscus uses Discussions. I thought Discussions would make more sense than issues since it's a comment system, so I chose Giscus over Utterances.

## Design

As a non-designer myself, it was really hard to design everything from scratch. So I searched for other developer blogs and documentations for inspiration and got some ideas from each site.

These are the ones I was mainly inspired by:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)
- [Delba](https://delba.dev/)

I wanted to make my design as simple as possible, so I use blue as the main color, and the rest is either black or gray.

What I cared the most about is the **white space**. I've seen many developers using lack of white space which end up looking really bad. So I put margins and paddings rather exessively if you have noticed.

Instead of decorating headings, I put white space. **This helps keep its simplicity.**

Although I'm not completely satisfied, I'll go with this for now.

## Upcoming updates

As the blog grows, I am going to add more functionalities and other stuff. For now, I'm thinking of these updates:

- Contact form
- Pagination
- Comment system
- Like button on each post
- Google Analytics
- Replace everything with TypeScript

I could have done some of these before, but I was afraid I could go on and on and end up not publishing forever.

If you have any request, please leave a comment or send me messages throguh Twitter or Contact form.
