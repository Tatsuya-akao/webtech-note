I originally own a blog on WordPress, where I share my knowledge and experience as a web developer. Now that I've spent almost 3 years working on it, I decided to start a new blog with modern tech stack.

After struggling for a few months, I managed to deploy this blog which is my very first Next.js project. In this article, I'm gonna briefly explain how I built this MDX blog with Next.js.

<Box type="warning">
  This article is <span>not a step-by-step guide or tutorial.</span> I'll post
  an another article for that topic.
</Box>

## Tech Stack

Here's the list of the tech stack I used for this blog, and I'll explain why I chose them.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [CSS Modules (Sass)](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home)

### Next.js

Next.js is a React framework for building web applications. I chose Next.js for the following reasons.

<Box type="success_l">
  <UnorderedList>
    <li>It is built with React</li>
    <li>It offers two types of pre-rendering: SSR and SSG</li>
    <li>It has many performance optimizations</li>
    <li>It works great with MDX</li>
  </UnorderedList>
</Box>

For pre-rendering options, I use SSG (Static Site Generation) because my blog contents are totally static. It generates the HTML at build time, and it will be reused on each request, unlike SSR that generates the HTML on every request.

On top of SSG, Next.js has so many performance optimization such as code-splitting, `next/image`, `next/font`, `next/script`, etc.

These features make the website super fast.

### CSS Modules (Sass)

For styling, I used CSS Modules with Sass. Next.js has built-in support for CSS Modules, and you can use Sass by simply installing `sass` package.

By adding `.module.scss` at the end of a file name, you can write a component-scoped styles with Sass features like nesting, variables, and mixins. Also, you don't need to worry about class name conflicts thanks to scoping.

I write all the styles by myself because it's much more flexible than using CSS libraries like Bootstrap. For now I'm satisfied with CSS modules and Sass, but I will probably try some of CSS in JS libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) in the future.

### MDX

MDX is a format that allows you to include JSX in Markdown documents. This means **you can import and use custom React components** in markdown files.

I actually thoght about using headless CMS for managing contents, but I didn't like the idea of writing contents in the editor, because the variety of the parts you can use are limited and it would be so hard or impossible to create and use custom components.

In MDX, there's almost no restriction on what you wanna show in the articles. If you want some custom blog parts, you can simply create a component, include it and use it in a mdx file.

To give you an example, I have a `Box` component for wrapping the contents with a certain background color depending on the value of `type` props. In MDX, I use a component like this:

<CodeHead lang="mdx" />

```mdx
<Box type="success">This is a box component.</Box>
```

When this is rendered, it looks like below:

<Box type="success">This is a box component.</Box>

This is a pretty simple component, but you can create more complex and interactive components and include them wherever you want.

### Contentlayer

> Contentlayer is a content preprocessor that validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON you can easily import into your application.
>
> [Contentlayer Documentation â€“ Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs)

I use Contentlayer as a content processor. It converts my mdx files into type-safe JSON data, and I can easily import them in pages.

I have tried `@next/mdx`, `mdx-bundler`, `next-mdx-remote`, but none of them were better than Contentlayer in terms of the amount of code you have to write, and many other advantages such as the following:

<Box type="success_l">
  <UnorderedList>
    <li>Convert contents into data</li>
    <li>Easily import data just like you import libraries or components</li>
    <li>Automatic type definitions</li>
    <li>Built-in validations for your content & frontmatter</li>
    <li>Error messages in console for debugging</li>
    <li>Live reloading</li>
  </UnorderedList>
</Box>

Another good thing is that they show how to set up everything using Next.js in [their documentation](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started), so all you need is just to follow the guide and you will have a MDX blog with Contentlayer and Next.js.

### Vercel

Vercel is a cloud platform for serverless deployment, created by the Next.js team.

I simply chose it because Vercel's platform and Next.js are developed by the same company, and I thought they would work well together.

> Vercel is the fastest way to deploy your Next.js application with zero configuration.
>
> When deploying to Vercel, the platform automatically detects Next.js, runs next build, and optimizes the build output for you.

To deploy my site, all I need to do is to push my projects to the main branch in my Git repository. Then, Vercel will automatically create a production deployment.

For a custom domain, I bought one on [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) but you can also buy it through Vercel.

## Design

As a non-designer myself, it was really hard to design everything from scratch. So I searched for other developer blogs and documentations for inspiration and got some ideas from each site.

These are the ones I was mainly inspired by:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)
- [Delba](https://delba.dev/)

I wanted to make my design as simple as possible, so I use blue as the main color, and the rest is either black or gray.

What I cared the most about is the **white space**. I've seen many developers using lack of white space which end up looking really bad. So I put margins and paddings rather exessively if you have noticed.

Instead of decorating headings, I put white space. **This helps keep its simplicity.**

Although I'm not completely satisfied, I'll go with this for now.

## Upcoming updates

As the blog grows, I am going to add more functionalities and other stuff. For now, I'm thinking of these updates:

- Contact form
- Pagination
- Comment system
- Like button on each post
- Google Analytics
- Replace everything with TypeScript

I could have done some of these before, but I was afraid I could go on and on and end up not publishing forever.

If you have any request, please leave a comment or send me messages throguh Twitter or Contact form.
