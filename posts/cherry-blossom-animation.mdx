When you create components such as `Button` or `Heading` which output elements with various options of HTML tags, what do you do?

In this article, I am going to explain how to pass HTML tags with props in React.

<Box type="success">This is the sample box.</Box>

By doing this, you can pass any kinds of heading tags.

</Box>

That's all. Now move on to another article.
