## Title tags

I have `h2` ~ `h5` for heading tags.

## Link tags

There are 3 ways how I can set link tags.

### 1. The default MDX syntax

The first one is the default `a` tag with MDX syntax.

<CodeHead lang="mdx" />

```mdx
[Next.js](https://google.com)
```

Inside the `[]` is a text, and `()` is a URL. By using MDX syntax, you cannot add attributes like `target` or `rel`.

### 2. OuterLink (Custom component)

`<OuterLink />` is a custom component for generating outer links. The attribute `target="_blank"` is set by default.

<CodeHead lang="jsx" />

```jsx
<OuterLink href="https://google.com">Text</OuterLink>
```

### 3. Link

Finally, we have `<Link />` component for generating links to another page in the same domain.

<CodeHead lang="jsx" />

```jsx
<Link href="/about">About</Link>
```

This is made by Next.js.

## List tags

We have `ul` and `ol` tags.

### ul - Unordered list

<CodeHead lang="mdx" />

```mdx
- list 01
- list 02
- list 03
```

When this is rendered, it looks like:

- list 01
- list 02
- list 03

### ol - Ordered list

<CodeHead lang="mdx" />

```mdx
1. list 01
2. list 02
3. list 03
```

When this is rendered, it looks like:

1. list 01
2. list 02
3. list 03

## Blockquote

You can set `blockquote` by typing `>` and then put a text after the symbol.

> This is blockquote. This can be multi lines if the text is long. This is blockquote. This can be multi lines if the text is long.
>
> This is blockquote. This can be multi lines if the text is long.

<CodeHead lang="mdx" />

```mdx
> This is a blockquote.
```

## Images

I have created a custom component `<BlogImage />` and here's how it works.

<CodeHead lang="mdx" />

```mdx
<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/first-post.png"
  alt="sample img"
  width={1600}
  height={900}
  caption="This is a sample caption for blog image component. When a string is passed to the caption prop, this gets rendered. Otherwise, this figcaption won't appear."
/>
```

This should look like below:

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/first-post.png"
  alt="sample img"
  width={1600}
  height={900}
  caption="This is a sample caption for blog image component. When a string is passed to the caption prop, this gets rendered. Otherwise, this figcaption won't appear."
/>

All props must be passed except `caption`.

## Syntax Highlighter

We have a syntax highlighter for showing the code.

You must have `<CodeHead />` component above the code block.

<CodeHead lang="mdx" />

```mdx
<CodeHead lang="mdx" />
```

`<CodeHead />` is for a file name(optional) and a language.

When you set `name` props, it looks like this:

<CodeHead name="/posts/sample.mdx" lang="mdx" />

```mdx
<CodeHead lang="mdx" />
```

### Code block options

There are several options for code block.

#### showLineNumbers

By adding `showLineNumbers`, you can show the numbers in the block.

<CodeHead name="/posts/sample.mdx" lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers
import margin from "@/styles/components/blog/margin.module.scss";
import { IoLogoJavascript, IoLogoHtml5 } from "react-icons/io5";

export default function CodeHead({ name, lang }) {
  const langData = outputLanguageString(lang);

  return (
    <div className={`${s.code_head} ${margin.t_medium}`}>
      <div className={s.text_wrap}>
        {name && <span className={s.name}>{name}</span>}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you wanna start from the specific number, you can pass numbers like `showLineNumbers{5}`.

<CodeHead name="/posts/sample.mdx" lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers{5}
import margin from "@/styles/components/blog/margin.module.scss";
import { IoLogoJavascript, IoLogoHtml5 } from "react-icons/io5";
```

#### Highlight specific line(s) of code

You can highlight specific lines by passing `{1, 2}`, or `{1-5}` for multi lines. It is recommended to use this feature with `showLineNumbers`.

<CodeHead name="/posts/sample.mdx" lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers {5-9}
export default function CodeHead({ name, lang }) {
  const langData = outputLanguageString(lang);

  return (
    <div className={`${s.code_head} ${margin.t_medium}`}>
      <div className={s.text_wrap}>
        {name && <span className={s.name}>{name}</span>}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Box

We have a `Box` component to wrap up contents with colored background. For now, there are 3 types of box.

- default
- success
- warning

<Box>This is a default box.</Box>

<Box type="success">This is a success box.</Box>

<Box type="warning">This is a warning box.</Box>

The component takes 1 prop which is `type`, and you can pass a string to it.

<CodeHead name="/posts/sample.mdx" lang="mdx" />

```mdx
<Box type="success">This is a success box.</Box>
```
