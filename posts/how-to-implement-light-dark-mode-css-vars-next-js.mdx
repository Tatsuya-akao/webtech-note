Having a dark mode is a common feature for modern websites. It would be great for user experience to have an option to toggle between light / dark mode depending on user's preference.

In this article, I'll show you how to implement a dark mode in your Next.js apps.

## Prerequisite

<Box type="success_l">
  <UnorderedList>
    <li>You use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for your site or app</li>
    <li>
      You use [CSS
      Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
      for managing colors
    </li>
  </UnorderedList>
</Box>

## What we build

These are the features of what we are gonna build.

<Box type="success_l">
  <UnorderedList>
    <li>The user can toggle to switch between Light and Dark mode.</li>
    <li>The user's system settings will be applied for their first visit.</li>
    <li>
      The prefered theme setting will be preserved in `localStorage` for their
      next visit.
    </li>
  </UnorderedList>
</Box>

If this is what you want, follow along this tutorial.

## Step 1. Install next-themes package

We need only 1 package for implementing Dark mode.

Open the terminal and install `next-themes` package.

<CodeHead lang="console" />

```console
$ npm install next-themes
# or
$ yarn add next-themes
```

## Step 2. Create a CSS file for managing colors

Now, we need to create a CSS file to store all the colors in Light / Dark mode. Create `/styles/colors.css` file and set your colors like this:

<CodeHead name="/styles/colors.css" lang="css" />

```css showLineNumbers
:root {
  /* Your default theme */
  --background: white;
  --foreground: black;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --background: black;
  --foreground: white;
}
```

The `root` pseudo-class selects the root element which is `html` tag. The variables in this scope will be applied to Light mode.

And as you can guess, `[data-theme='dark']` will be applied to Dark mode. This `data-theme` attribute is added and updated whenever the user toggles the theme.

## Step 3. Use CSS variables in your .css files

Skip this section if you already know how to use CSS variables.

Previously we created a `colors.css` and configured colors for Light / Dark mode. Now, we need to apply those CSS variables in the stylesheets.

Here's an exapmle of how you write CSS variables.

<CodeHead name="/styles/globals.css" lang="css" />

```css showLineNumbers
body {
  background-color: var(--background);
  color: var(--foreground);
}
```

Like the example code above, replace all the hard-coded colors with CSS variables.

## Step 4. add ThemeProvider in \_app.js

To enable dark mode, we need to do 2 things in `_app.js` file which are the following:

1. Wrap the whole app with `ThemeProvider`
2. Import `colors.css`

<CodeHead name="_app.js" lang="js" />

```js showLineNumbers {1,2, 6-8}
import "@/styles/colors.css";
import { ThemeProvider } from "next-themes";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

That's it! Now your Next.js app supports dark mode.

If you refresh the page, you'll see `data-theme` attribute on `html` tag. The value would be either `light` or `dark` depending on your system settings.

## Step 5. create Theme Switch component

Now that we've implemented a dark mode, let's create a component to toggle between `light` and `dark` mode.

Create `/components/theme-switch.jsx` file and paste the code below:

<CodeHead name="/components/theme-switch.jsx" lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useTheme } from "next-themes";

export default function ThemeSwitch() {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
  const { resolvedTheme, setTheme } = useTheme();

  // useEffect only runs on the client, so now we can safely show the UI
  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);
  }, []);
  if (!mounted) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <p>Current theme: {resolvedTheme}</p>
      <button
        onClick={() => setTheme(resolvedTheme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}
      >
        <span>Toggle Theme</span>
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

I prepared the live demo of this code. You can try it out by clicking the "Toggle Theme" button.

<ThemeSwitch />

Every time you click on the button, the value of `data-theme` attribute on `html` element will be switched.

### Code explanation

First of all, we need to write a code to avoid hydration mismatch error.

<CodeHead lang="jsx" />

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true);
}, []);
if (!mounted) {
  return null;
}

return {
  /* component here */
};
```

This is officially recommended way so if you wanna know more about it, please check out the [next-themes GitHub page](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).

#### setTheme

To set the theme, we use `setTheme` function prepared by `next-themes`.

<CodeHead lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers
// Set [data-theme="light"]
<button onClick={() => setTheme("light")}>
```

You can simply pass the theme name as a string, and it will set it to `data-theme` attribute of the root element.

Since we wanna toggle the themes, we can write like this:

<CodeHead lang="jsx" />

```jsx showLineNumbers
<button
  onClick={() => setTheme(resolvedTheme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")}
>
```

If the current theme is `light`, switch it to `dark`, otherwise set is as `light`.

#### resolvedTheme

`next-themes` provides `theme` and `resolvedTheme` that return the active theme name.

These two behave almost the same but the difference is whether it supports `system` theme or not.

<CodeHead lang="js" />

```js showLineNumbers
console.log("theme: ", theme);
console.log("resolvedTheme:", resolvedTheme);
```

I changed my Mac OS setting to 'dark' and this is the result:

`theme` understands that the current theme is `system`, but it doesn't know whether the system setting is `light` or `dark`.

So if you want to support the system setting, use `resolvedTheme`.

## Testing

Now, let's see if the code is working. When you visit the site for the first time, `next-themes` stores the active theme value in `localStorage`.

To see this, open your developer tool in your browser (In my case, I use Google Chrome). Click on [Application] tab and choose [Local Storage] from the left menu bar.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/how-to-implement-light-dark-mode-css-vars-next-js/local-storage.png"
  alt="Local storage"
  width={1440}
  height={551}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
/>

For the first visitor, `theme:system` is stored in here. Try checking if the system setting is reflected by switching the appearance mode.

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/how-to-implement-light-dark-mode-css-vars-next-js/system-light.png"
  alt="Whene system setting is light"
  width={1440}
  height={845}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
>
  System Settings > Appearance: Light
</BlogImage>

<BlogImage
  src="/images/posts/how-to-implement-light-dark-mode-css-vars-next-js/system-dark.png"
  alt="Whene system setting is dark"
  width={1440}
  height={845}
  hasBorder
  hasShadow
>
  System Settings > Appearance: Dark
</BlogImage>

If the visitor clicks on the toggle button, `theme` value will be updated and stored in the storage.

You can check it yourself by clicking the button below:

<ThemeSwitch />

That's it! Now your website supports the system theme, and is capable of switching between Light / Dark mode.

In this article, I showed you the most basic example. If you wanna know more about `next-themes`, please check out [their official page](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).
